# Learning Rust
This repo is here to follow my progress learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming languages.

It contains code for examples and exercises from [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), split into folders corresponding to chapter numbers.

I'm writing these in vim (all being well), partially to force myself to not rely on VS Code's autocompletion & linting, and partially to finally memorise vim & tmux's keybindings.
